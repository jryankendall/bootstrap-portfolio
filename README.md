## About
- Bootstrap-portfolio is an example website made for a homework assignment for February 4th, 2019 Vanderbilt Bootcamp Class. It's my Basic-Portfolio completely rebuilt from the ground-up to use Bootstrap and its JS. This makes it far more responsive and easily read on smaller viewports. Learned about SASS/SCSS and decided to use it for building my CSS.
